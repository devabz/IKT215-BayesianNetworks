## Abstract
If the conditional probability tables (CPTs) are not known beforehand, then given a dataset $\mathbf{\Omega}$ comprising of $n$ samples and $q$ observations, where each observation describes a set of discrete events $\{X_i = j\}$, where $i, j, k \in \mathbf{\Omega} \ | \  i, k \in \mathbb{N}$ , then, by leveraging the relationship between joint probabilities and conditional probabilities, we can express the likelihood of observing a combination of events in terms of smaller components.
